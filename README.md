# Event-Driven Data Pipeline with Terraform

## 📝 Overview

This project demonstrates an **event-driven data pipeline** fully managed using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform**.  
The pipeline is designed to automatically trigger on specific cloud events (e.g., a file upload to a storage bucket) and process the data through serverless compute and other components.

The goal is to build a **reproducible, automated, and scalable** data pipeline using Terraform.
